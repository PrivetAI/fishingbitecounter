# Fishing Bite Counter

Fishing Bite Counter is a mobile application designed for ice fishing enthusiasts who want to track and analyse their fishing sessions in detail. The app allows anglers to record every bite and catch across multiple fishing holes, providing valuable insights into which spots are most productive. By keeping detailed statistics, fishermen can optimise their strategy, identify patterns, and improve their overall success rate on the ice.
